                <p>The seat height of a motorcycle can make it easier or harder to ride, with low being easier.  Generally, cruisers are the lowest while off-road and touring bikes are higher.</p>

                        <p>However, if your <a href="skill-level.html">skill level</a> is higher, you can likely ride bikes higher than recommended without trouble.</p>
